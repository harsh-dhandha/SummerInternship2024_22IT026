## üìù Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: Creating AWS Free Tier Account
- Created an AWS Free Tier account as part of Task 1.
- Logged on to the AWS Console (Task 2).
- Explored AWS Billing and Cost Management (Task 3).
- Set up a zero-dollar limit budget (Task 4).
- Launched an EC2 instance from the free tier options (Task 5).

### Day 2: 
- Connected to the EC2 Instance (Task 6):
After launching the EC2 instance, I connected to it using SSH. This allowed me to access the virtual server, which is essentially a remote computer running on AWS infrastructure. The connection was established securely using the provided key pair, ensuring that my data remains protected.
(-Commands : 
shell- to write command in it
pwd-current web directory
whoami-this will which user is as logged in this account )

- Installed an Apache Web Server on the Linux Instance (Task 7):
Once connected, I installed Apache, a widely-used open-source web server software. Apache is crucial for serving web pages to users. The installation involved updating the package repositories and using package management commands to install Apache on the Linux-based EC2 instance.
(-Commands : sudo su-to elevate your credentials to root
yum install -y httpd- to install apache web server(Linux server)
cd /var/www/html- to create a HTML file into directory)

- Deployed a Personal page.html on Apache (Task 8):
With Apache running, I deployed a simple HTML page (page.html). This involved placing the HTML file in Apache‚Äôs root directory and configuring the server to serve this page. Deploying the HTML page allowed me to create a personal webpage accessible over the internet via the EC2 instance's public IP address.
